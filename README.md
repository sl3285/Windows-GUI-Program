Windows GUI Program (C++, MS Visual Studio, Win32 API)\n
•	Develop a GUI that automatically reads a text file and stores the values locally to an array of structures, and displays them legibly in a scrollable list.
•	Build an ADD thread and a DELETE thread to add/delete the information to/from both the viewable list and the local array.
•	Build a REFRESH thread to periodically update the local array to ensure it is a current copy of the file
•	Use two synchronization mechanisms to protect two shared resources.
•	Build a sleep() function along with a randomly generated time to sleep to simulate network and file I/O delays of a very heavily utilized network.
